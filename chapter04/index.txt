Recipe 4.1. Manually Consuming an Iterator

    Problem: You need to process items in an iterable, but for whatever reason, you can't or don't want to use a for
        loop.

    Solution: To manually consume an iterable, use the next() function and write your code to catch the StopIteration
        exception.
