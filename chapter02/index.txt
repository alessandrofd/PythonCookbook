Recipe 2.1. Splitting Strings on Any of Multiple Delimiters

    Problem: You need to split a string into fields, but the delimiters (and spacing around them) aren't consistent
        throughout the string.

    Solution: The split() method of string objects is really meant for very simple case, and does not allow for multiple
        delimiters or account for possible whitespace around the delimiters. In cases when you need a bit more
        flexibility, use the re.split() method.
