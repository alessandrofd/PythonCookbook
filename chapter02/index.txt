Recipe 2.1. Splitting Strings on Any of Multiple Delimiters

    Problem: You need to split a string into fields, but the delimiters (and spacing around them) aren't consistent
        throughout the string.

    Solution: The split() method of string objects is really meant for very simple case, and does not allow for multiple
        delimiters or account for possible whitespace around the delimiters. In cases when you need a bit more
        flexibility, use the re.split() method.

Recipe 2.4. Matching and Searching for Text Patterns

    Problem: You want to match or search text for a specific pattern.

    Solution: If the text you're trying to match is a simple literal, you can often just use the
        basic string methods, such as str.find(), str.endswith(), str.startswith(), or similar.

Recipe 2.8. Writing a Regular Expression for Multiline Patterns

    Problem: You're trying to match a block of text using a regular expression, but you need the match to span multiple
        lines.

    Solution: This problem typically arises in patterns that use the dot (.) to match any character but forget to
        account for the fact that it doesn't match newlines. To fix the problem, you can add the support for newlines.
